Problem :

Describe the problem in a concise way to **let folks easily identify** if they have the same issue

Solution :

 * Describe a reproductible way to solve the issue as you can. keep in mind many users are non technical persons that should be able to do the trick from your steps.
 * A link to external ressource has a great chance to be removed to prevent user running arbitrary code on their devices. 
 * If commands are provided (let say bash things), it must remain simple and concise and must NOT trigger arbitrary code (e.g curl http://something-bad.sh | bash)
 * Specific commands with explicit values might be allowed sed -i s/thing/newvalue/ /home/deck/path/to/game/settings.ini

Have a look to existing tricks for inspiration ðŸ˜‰

I am open to any suggestion, do not hesitate to ask / share !
